# Context

In this repo, you will find my final submission for a coursework during my masters studies.
The aim (split in two parts) was to teach more advanced web app concepts
and implement them. C# ASP.net was used as the underlying technology.
Part of the assessment of course relied on students to improvise and design from 
scratch with a very small foundation as to best fufil requirements.
